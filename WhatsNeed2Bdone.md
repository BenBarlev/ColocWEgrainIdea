and a littel bit of whts going on.
First, we need a "profile" builder. connected to another social network.

then there is a search on Facebook \Insta \Redit etc for comments over topics that are in the user scope (or by choice).

grab those comments (after verifying its totally legal etc)

without pictures, without even name, it doesn't really matter, just the comment, varchar I guess. CSV.

I understand I'll have to learn Python for that.


I actually thought of trying to learn just how to read what real developers did and focus on learning the configurations.

Do let me know if it's a stupid idea/



Ok go on to the MVP:

we had our basic GRAB


Now we want to represent each 





each comment according to its size will have a "box" that the comment lives in.
again in short - 
auto search for leading topics among the pile - and moving those comments to a bach, you can give it a liable of your on.


The user should have a set of tools, that with them he is mining in the pile.

"Grouping" - No need to describe. literally the first tool the user need.



"Trimming" - The ability to reach to a comment that someone else wrote and trim the bases ideas out of it.
think of it as the functional way to deal with a long massage with many different ideas in them.
A thing to consider before trimming is to deal with the context - if you trim something in the middle that goes: "she will not tolerate"

we need to know who is "she".
