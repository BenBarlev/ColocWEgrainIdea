and a littel bit of whts going on.
First, we need a "profile" builder. connected to another social network.



then there is a search on Facebook insta Youtube etc for comments over topics that are in the user scope.

grab those comments after verifying its totally legal and so

without pictures, without even name, it doesn't really matter.


and bring them to the first screen the user sees:

a swarm of comments flying around finding common topics to join over the black screen.
the swarm has settled and you start your journey

again in short - 
auto search for leading topics among the pile - and moving those comments to a bach, you can give it a liable of your on.


The user should have a set of tools, that with them he is mining in the pile.

"Grouping" - No need to describe. literally the first tool the user need.



"Trimming" - The ability to reach to a comment that someone else wrote and trim the bases ideas out of it.
think of it as the functional way to deal with a long massage with many different ideas in them.
A thing to consider before trimming is to deal with the context - if you trim something in the middle that goes: "she will not tolerate"

we need to know who is "she".
