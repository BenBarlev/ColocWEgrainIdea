We are learning to communicate on a new level of volume.

and it will be own by you and me (and they but also no one.)


colocWE is an ambitious project suggesting we can form a new way of communication for large number of participants.

After the research has done (will write a document about it one day) :

The  3 bigest "better deal with" are:

## 1. Overload -
too much comments in too many difrent dabets. "everything has olready been said" (thats not true but for now its fine)


## 2. Echo-chamber-
we are soruonded by bariers that not leting us see the whole picture. in short-

We are exposed to the thoughts that we are already agree with
              Behind this lies the language barrier
       And when you solve it then good luck with "culture" and "values".

## 3. Structure / coherence / visualization -
it all means the same thing.





The 3 things that can "solve" or at list try to dig something out of it are:

1.
## Grab
it's actually dealing with the second "problem" - the echo chamber, but its the first thing to do.
the mission Is to collect (or index\store\?) all unique ideas and opinions been made in a lot of discussions about a specific topic. (#whatever)
from a lot of different debates - from the various side of a country as a start to translations and over languages and cultures barriers.
and its actually Grab distinct but I trimmed it.
that was <b>Grab.</b>

## Filter
Dealing with the Overload

Coupling, gruping, Trimming and Mega Coupling the number of repetitions of an idea into one.
Ther are infinity amount of loops running in the web discussions.
no one read what someone wrote 50 comments ago and the loops are starting all over again.
But nehter the less there are gold and pearls in the stew shouted around the bone fire - 2% comments where Unique .(out of small debates) 
most of the time those were the "out of the box" ideas \opinions \perspective \input.
sometimes they can open the discussion to a new point. (and basically, we are doing all of colocWE for this specific "rare" moments. we want to allow them to happen. but in bigger volume)

and then

Painting & Marking (P&M) anything possible:
sub-topics, the side in the debate, the role of the comment in the debate. 
Its a preparation for the next step.
And I think while most of it should be automated, it still should be done and supervised and mange by real users.

## Structure / coherence / visualization - it all means the same thing.

So
Comments have various roles in a debate 
                *Questions*, 
                            !Objections!, 
                                         *=An example of an occurrence=,
*=!The reasons for an occurrence=! (these guys know better than you. and sometimes (rare) it's not a joke)
                                                  ?-!suggestions for solutions?-! (I love this ones)
-- *"no value" - not necessarily the most violent or nasty comments, they just didn't bring any value relevant to the debate - commercials, other topics, out of context etc.--
and just to make a point - an emoji as a comment can totally bring value to a debate. 
not necessarily a unique one - but value.ðŸ˜Š
And -
After trimmed and cupeled and P&M we can totally relate and form it into the bush a discussion looks like.
In Hebrew debate and bush have the same meaning - go figure.

looking from above on a flow of a debate
4-10 minutes you are in the picture.
now you -  bring value. say something unique.
the biggest dream is to achieve agreements out of it.


and that's, more or less - colocWE.

tell me your opinions - i know you have some
